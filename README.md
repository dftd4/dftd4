### Building from Source

To build this project from the source code in this repository you need to have
a Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008 and one of the supported build systems:
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com) version 0.55 or newer, with
  a build-system backend, *i.e.* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) version 1.7 or newer
- [cmake](https://cmake.org) version 3.14 or newer, with
  a build-system backend, *i.e.* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) version 1.10 or newer
- [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) version 0.2.0 or newer

Currently this project supports GCC and Intel compilers.

<details>
<summary>Problematic Versions</summary>

GCC versions 15.0.x - 15.1.x contain a [compiler bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=119928) leading to "Interface mismatch" errors during compilation.

</details>


#### Building with meson

To compile this version of DFT-D4 with meson the following programs are needed
(the number in parentheses specifies the tested versions).

To build this project from the source code in this repository you need to have
- a Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com) version 0.55 or newer
- a build-system backend, *i.e.* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) version 1.7 or newer
- a LAPACK / BLAS provider, like MKL or OpenBLAS

Optional dependencies are
- asciidoctor to build the manual page
- FORD to build the developer documentation
- C compiler to test the C-API and compile the Python extension module
- Python 3.6 or newer with the CFFI package installed to build the Python API

Setup a build with

```sh
meson setup _build
```

You can select the Fortran compiler by the `FC` environment variable.
To compile and run the projects testsuite use

```sh
meson test -C _build --print-errorlogs
```

If the testsuite passes you can install with

```sh
meson configure _build --prefix=/path/to/install
meson install -C _build
```

This might require administrator access depending on the chosen install prefix.


#### Building with CMake

Alternatively, this project can be build with CMake (in this case ninja 1.10 or newer is required):

```
cmake -B _build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
```

To compile the project with CMake run

```
cmake --build _build
```

You can run the project testsuite with

```
ctest --test-dir _build --parallel --output-on-failure
```

Finally, you can install the project to the selected prefix

```
cmake --install _build
```

Note that the CMake build does not support to build the Python extension module as part of the main build.


#### Building with fpm

This project support the Fortran package manager (fpm).
Invoke fpm in the project root with

```
fpm build
```

To run the testsuite use

```
fpm test
```

You can access the ``dftd4`` program using the run subcommand

```
fpm run -- --help
```

To use ``dftd4`` for testing include it as dependency in your package manifest

```toml
[dependencies]
dftd4.git = "https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4"
```

Note that the fpm build does not support exporting the C-API, it only provides access to the standalone binary.


## Usage

DFT-D4 calculations can be performed with the `dftd4` executable.
To calculate the dispersion correction for PBE0-D4 run:

```sh
dftd4 --func pbe0 coord
```

In case you want to access the DFT-D4 results from other programs, dump the results to JSON with
(the `--noedisp` flag prevents the `.EDISP` file generation):

```sh
dftd4 --func pbe0 --json --grad --noedisp struct.xyz
```

Dispersion related properties can be calculated as well:

```sh
dftd4 --property geo.gen
```

To evaluate pairwise resolved dispersion energies use

```sh
dftd4 --pair-resolved mol.xyz
```

For an overview over all command line arguments use the `--help` argument or checkout the [`dftd4(1)`](https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4/blob/main/man/dftd4.1.adoc) manpage.


### Parallelism

DFT-D4 calculations can be performed with shared-memory parallelism (OpenMP).

The number of parallel threads can be set through environment variables.

```sh
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=4  # Intel
```

For large calculations, additional speed-ups might be possible by enabling dynamic scheduling in OMP by setting `OMP_SCHEDULE=dynamic`.
This might help particularly for versions <4.0.0 ([explanation](https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4/pull/319)).

Note that DFT-D4 is not MPI parallelized.


## Parameters

DFT-D4 is parametrized for plenty of density functionals.
The available parameters are listed in the [parameters.toml file](https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4/blob/main/assets/parameters.toml) or with the following command.

```sh
dftd4 param --list
```

While the functionals can be selected with their common names (e.g., `PBE`), the [libxc](https://www.tddft.org/programs/libxc/functionals/) names can also be used (e.g., `GGA_X_PBE:GGA_C_PBE`).

```sh
dftd4 --func PBE coord
dftd4 --func GGA_X_PBE:GGA_C_PBE coord
```

The exchange and correlation functional must be separated by a colon.
All names are case-insensitive.

<details>
<summary>Note on ωB97X-type functionals</summary>

Since there has been some confusion concerning the different ωB97X functionals, we provide a detailed summary: 

- [ωB97X](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2834918) (original functional, 2008, parameters: `wb97x-2008`)
- [ωB97X-D](https://doi.org/10.1039/B810189B) (re-optimization of ωB97X to include dispersion correction, 2008, no D4 parameters)
- [ωB97X-D3](https://doi.org/10.1021/ct300715s) (re-optimization of ωB97X-D with improved dispersion corrections, D3(0), 2013, no D4 parameters)
- [ωB97X-V](https://doi.org/10.1039/C3CP54374A) (new functional, different from the above ωB97X's and not just a re-optimization for VV10 dispersion, 2013)
- [ωB97X-D4](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26411) (ωB97X-V with D4 dispersion instead of VV10 dispersion, parameters: `wb97x`)
- [ωB97X-D4rev](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0133026) (revised D4 parameters for ωB97X-V with D4 dispersion instead of VV10 dispersion, parameters: `wb97x-rev`)
- [ωB97X-3c](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0133026) (Composite "3c" method based on ωB97X-V, parameters: `wb97x-3c`)

Note that the ωB97X parameters (`wb97x-2008`) cannot be used for the ωB97X-V functional (`wb97x`, `wb97x-rev`).
We recommend the revised D4 parameters for ωB97X-V (`wb97x-rev`).

</details>

<br>

You can add new functionals using to the TOML file by adding a new subtable

```toml
[parameter.name]
reference.doi = ["<functional reference>"]
d4.bj-eeq-atm = { s8=1.0, a1=0.4, a2=5.0, doi="<parameter reference>" }
```

Those parameters are currently only used as reference and not yet usable in the library or executable.


## API access

The DFT-D4 project provides first class API support Fortran, C and Python.
Other programming languages should try to interface with to DFT-D4 via one of those three APIs.
To provide first class API support for a new language the interface specification should be available as meson build files.

The `dftd4` binary provides with the `--json` option access to all quantities available from the APIs as well.


### Fortran API

The recommended way to access the Fortran module API is by using `dftd4` as a meson subproject.
Alternatively, the project is accessible by the Fortran package manager ([fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)).

The complete API is available from `dftd4` module, the individual modules are available to the user as well but are not part of the public API and therefore not guaranteed to remain stable.
ABI compatibility is only guaranteed for the same minor version.

The communication with the Fortran API uses the `error_type` and `structure_type` of the modular computation tool chain library (mctc-lib) to handle errors and represent geometries, respectively.


#### Building Vasp with support for D4

To use ``dftd4`` in Vasp the compatibility layer for the 2.5.x API has to be enable with ``-Dapi_v2=true`` (meson) or ``-DWITH_API_V2=ON`` (CMake).
It is important to build ``dftd4`` with the same Fortran compiler you build Vasp with.

After you completed the installation of ``dftd4``, make sure it is findable by ``pkg-config``, you can check by running:

```
pkg-config --modversion dftd4
```

If your ``dftd4`` installation is not findable, you have to update your environment variables.
One option is to provide a module file for your ``dftd4`` installation.
The example module file below can be placed in your ``MODULEPATH`` to provide access to an installation in ``~/opt/dftd4/4.0.0``.
Retry the above comment after loading the ``dftd4`` module and adjust the module file until ``pkg-config`` finds your installation.

```lua
-- dftd4/4.0.0.lua
local name = "dftd4"
local version = "4.0.0"
local prefix = pathJoin(os.getenv("HOME"), "opt", name, version)
local libdir = "lib"  -- or lib64

whatis("Name        : " .. name)
whatis("Version     : " .. version)
whatis("Description : Generally applicable charge dependent London dispersion correction")
whatis("URL         : https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4")

prepend_path("PATH", pathJoin(prefix, "bin"))
prepend_path("MANPATH", pathJoin(prefix, "share", "man"))
prepend_path("CPATH", pathJoin(prefix, "include"))
prepend_path("LIBRARY_PATH", pathJoin(prefix, libdir))
prepend_path("LD_LIBRARY_PATH", pathJoin(prefix, libdir))
prepend_path("PKG_CONFIG_PATH", pathJoin(prefix, libdir, "pkgconfig"))
```

To enable support for D4 in Vasp add the following lines to the Makefile:

```make
CPP_OPTIONS += -DDFTD4
LLIBS       += $(shell pkg-config --libs dftd4)
INCS        += $(shell pkg-config --cflags dftd4)
```

Depending on how you built DFT-D4, DFT-D4's dependencies might not be properly recognized during the VASP build. Try to explicitly add them to the link line.

```make
CPP_OPTIONS += -DDFTD4
LLIBS       += $(shell pkg-config --libs dftd4) -lmulticharge -lmctc-lib -lmstore
INCS        += $(shell pkg-config --cflags dftd4)
```

If you still run into issues, check out [VASP-related issues](https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4/issues?q=label%3Avasp%20) on the ``dftd4`` issue tracker.


### C API

The C API provides access to the basic Fortran objects and their most important methods to interact with them.
All Fortran objects are available as opaque `void*` in C and can only be manipulated with the correct API calls.
To evaluate a dispersion correction in C four objects are available:

1. the error handler:

   Simple error handler to carry runtime exceptions created by the library.
   Exceptions can be handled and/or transfered to the downstream error handling system by this means.

2. the molecular structure data:

   Provides a representation of the molecular structure with immutable number of atoms, atomic species, total charge and boundary conditions.
   The object provides a way to update coordinates and lattice parameters, to update immutable quantities the object has to be recreated.

3. the dispersion model:

   Instantiated for a given molecular structure type, it carries no information on the geometry but relies on the atomic species of the structure object.
   Recreating a structure object requires to recreate the dispersion model as well.

4. the damping parameters:

   Damping parameter object determining the short-range behaviour of the dispersion correction.
   Standard damping parameters like the rational damping are independent of the molecular structure and can easily be reused for several structures or easily exchanged.

The user is responsible for creating and deleting the objects to avoid memory leaks.
For convenience the type-generic macro ``dftd4_delete`` is available to free any memory allocation made in the library.


### Python API

The Python API is disabled by default and can be built in-tree or out-of-tree.
The in-tree build is mainly meant for end users and packages.
To build the Python API with the normal project set the `python` option in the configuration step with

```sh
meson setup _build -Dpython=true -Dpython_version=$(which python3)
```

The Python version can be used to select a different Python version, it defaults to `'python3'`.
Python 2 is not supported with this project, the Python version key is meant to select between several local Python 3 versions.

Proceed with the build as described before and install the projects to make the Python API available in the selected prefix.

For the out-of-tree build see the instructions in the [`python`](https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4/blob/main/python) directory.
