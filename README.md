This is a minimal standalone version of DFT-D4 providing the D4(EEQ)-ATM method.


Installing
----------

To compile this version of DFT-D4 the following programs are needed
(the number in parentheses specifies the tested versions).

* `gfortran` or `ifort` compiler
* `meson` (0.53 or newer) and `ninja` (1.7 or newer) as build system
* `asciidoctor` to build the man-page

The program is build by

    $ FC=ifort meson setup build && ninja -C build

The binary is found at build/dftd4 and is ready to use.

The man-page can be build by

    $ asciidoc --doctype manpage --format manpage man1/dftd4.1.txt

By adding the directory to the `MANPATH` variable the documentation
of DFT-D4 is accessable by `man`.

`dftd4` as been successfully build using

* `ifort` 19.0.3 with the MKL as linear algebra backend
  on Manjaro Linux 18.0
* `gfortran` 8.3.0 with the MKL (19.0.3.199) as linear algebra backend
  on Manjaro Linux 18.0
* `gfortran` 8.3.0 with LAPACK (3.8.0-2) and openBLAS (0.3.6-1)
  as linear algebra backend on Manjaro Linux 18.0

`dftd4` could not be compiled with

* `gfortran` 4 or older (missing Fortran 2003 standard)


Available Package
-----------------

DFT-D4 is now also available for some package managers.

### Arch User Repository (AUR)


[![AUR stable](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/dftd4)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dftd4/)
[![AUR git](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/dftd4-git?label=aur-git)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dftd4-git/)

Get the build file from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) and use `makepkg`
(or your favorite wrapper) to build the package for `pacman`.
`dftd4` will be build with openBLAS backend, openMP and the most recent GCC.

The package build files are available [here](assets/aur) as submodules.


### Conda-Forge

[![Conda Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/dftd4.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dftd4)

Installing `dftd4` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `dftd4` can be installed with:

```
conda install dftd4
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `dftd4` available on your platform with:

```
conda search dftd4 --channel conda-forge
```


Usage
-----

DFT-D4 is invoked by

    $ dftd4 [options] <file>

where file is a valid xyz-file (coordinates in Ångström) or a
Turbomole coord file containing only the $coord data group with
coordinates in Bohr.

More information can be obtained from the manpage or by
invoking the program intern help page with `--help`.


Examples
--------

For a general D4 calculation to obtain C6 coefficients use

    $ dftd4 coord

To calculate a dispersion correction for a PBE0 calculation use

    $ dftd4 --func pbe0 coord

Note that, the `--func` option will try to make as much sense as
possible from your input, by converting it internally to lowercase
and ignoring most dashes or year number. The input `b-p` and `BP86/def-TZVP`
are therefore equivalent.

To calculate the derivative of the dispersion energy use

    $ dftd4 --func pbe0 --grad coord

This will write a Turbomole style `gradient` file or will try to
augment an already present `gradient` file with the dispersion gradient.

For the D4(EEQ)-MBD method use

    $ dftd4 --func pbe0 --mbd coord
