Installing A statically linked binary distribution for Linux platforms is available at the latest release tag. Conda package This project is packaged for the conda package manager and available on the conda-forge channel.\nTo install the conda package manager we recommend the miniforge installer.\nIf the conda-forge channel is not yet enabled, add it to your channels with conda config --add channels conda-forge Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, this project can be installed with: conda install dftd4 If you want to enable the Python API as well install conda install dftd4-python It is possible to list all of the versions available on your platform with: conda search dftd4 --channel conda-forge Now you are ready to use dftd4 . Spack package This project is available with spack in its develop version.\nYou can install and load dftd4 with spack install dftd4 spack load dftd4 The Python API can be enabled by adding +python to the command. FreeBSD Port A port for FreeBSD is available and can be installed using pkg install science/dftd4 In case no package is available build the port using cd /usr/ports/science/dftd4\nmake install clean For more information see the dftd4 port details . Building from Source To build this project from the source code in this repository you need to have\na Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008 and one of the supported build systems:\n- meson version 0.55 or newer, with\n  a build-system backend, i.e. ninja version 1.7 or newer\n- cmake version 3.14 or newer, with\n  a build-system backend, i.e. ninja version 1.10 or newer\n- fpm version 0.2.0 or newer Currently this project supports GCC and Intel compilers. Problematic Versions GCC versions 15.0.x - 15.1.x contain a [compiler bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=119928) leading to \"Interface mismatch\" errors during compilation. Building with meson To compile this version of DFT-D4 with meson the following programs are needed\n(the number in parentheses specifies the tested versions). To build this project from the source code in this repository you need to have\n- a Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008\n- meson version 0.55 or newer\n- a build-system backend, i.e. ninja version 1.7 or newer\n- a LAPACK / BLAS provider, like MKL or OpenBLAS Optional dependencies are\n- asciidoctor to build the manual page\n- FORD to build the developer documentation\n- C compiler to test the C-API and compile the Python extension module\n- Python 3.6 or newer with the CFFI package installed to build the Python API Setup a build with meson setup _build You can select the Fortran compiler by the FC environment variable.\nTo compile and run the projects testsuite use meson test -C _build --print-errorlogs If the testsuite passes you can install with meson configure _build --prefix = /path/to/install\nmeson install -C _build This might require administrator access depending on the chosen install prefix. Building with CMake Alternatively, this project can be build with CMake (in this case ninja 1.10 or newer is required): cmake -B _build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local To compile the project with CMake run cmake --build _build You can run the project testsuite with ctest --test-dir _build --parallel --output-on-failure Finally, you can install the project to the selected prefix cmake --install _build Note that the CMake build does not support to build the Python extension module as part of the main build. Building with fpm This project support the Fortran package manager (fpm).\nInvoke fpm in the project root with fpm build To run the testsuite use fpm test You can access the dftd4 program using the run subcommand fpm run -- --help To use dftd4 for testing include it as dependency in your package manifest [dependencies] dftd4 . git = \"https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4\" Note that the fpm build does not support exporting the C-API, it only provides access to the standalone binary. Usage DFT-D4 calculations can be performed with the dftd4 executable.\nTo calculate the dispersion correction for PBE0-D4 run: dftd4 --func pbe0 coord In case you want to access the DFT-D4 results from other programs, dump the results to JSON with\n(the --noedisp flag prevents the .EDISP file generation): dftd4 --func pbe0 --json --grad --noedisp struct.xyz Dispersion related properties can be calculated as well: dftd4 --property geo.gen To evaluate pairwise resolved dispersion energies use dftd4 --pair-resolved mol.xyz For an overview over all command line arguments use the --help argument or checkout the dftd4(1) manpage. Parallelism DFT-D4 calculations can be performed with shared-memory parallelism (OpenMP). The number of parallel threads can be set through environment variables. export OMP_NUM_THREADS = 4 export MKL_NUM_THREADS = 4 # Intel For large calculations, additional speed-ups might be possible by enabling dynamic scheduling in OMP by setting OMP_SCHEDULE=dynamic .\nThis might help particularly for versions <4.0.0 ( explanation ). Note that DFT-D4 is not MPI parallelized, and there are currently no plans to implement MPI parallelism. Parameters DFT-D4 is parametrized for plenty of density functionals.\nThe available parameters are listed in the parameters.toml file or with the following command. dftd4 param --list While the functionals can be selected with their common names (e.g., PBE ), the libxc names can also be used (e.g., GGA_X_PBE:GGA_C_PBE ). dftd4 --func PBE coord\ndftd4 --func GGA_X_PBE:GGA_C_PBE coord The exchange and correlation functional must be separated by a colon.\nAll names are case-insensitive. Note on ωB97X-type functionals Since there has been some confusion concerning the different ωB97X functionals, we provide a detailed summary: \n\n- [ωB97X](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2834918) (original functional, 2008, parameters: `wb97x-2008`)\n- [ωB97X-D](https://doi.org/10.1039/B810189B) (re-optimization of ωB97X to include dispersion correction, 2008, no D4 parameters)\n- [ωB97X-D3](https://doi.org/10.1021/ct300715s) (re-optimization of ωB97X-D with improved dispersion corrections, D3(0), 2013, no D4 parameters)\n- [ωB97X-V](https://doi.org/10.1039/C3CP54374A) (new functional, different from the above ωB97X's and not just a re-optimization for VV10 dispersion, 2013)\n- [ωB97X-D4](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26411) (ωB97X-V with D4 dispersion instead of VV10 dispersion, parameters: `wb97x`)\n- [ωB97X-D4rev](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0133026) (revised D4 parameters for ωB97X-V with D4 dispersion instead of VV10 dispersion, parameters: `wb97x-rev`)\n- [ωB97X-3c](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0133026) (Composite \"3c\" method based on ωB97X-V, parameters: `wb97x-3c`)\n\nNote that the ωB97X parameters (`wb97x-2008`) cannot be used for the ωB97X-V functional (`wb97x`, `wb97x-rev`).\n\nWe recommend the revised D4 parameters for ωB97X-V (`wb97x-rev`). You can add new functionals using to the TOML file by adding a new subtable [parameter.name] reference . doi = [ \"<functional reference>\" ] d4 . bj-eeq-atm = { s8 = 1.0 , a1 = 0.4 , a2 = 5.0 , doi = \"<parameter reference>\" } Those parameters are currently only used as reference and not yet usable in the library or executable. API access The DFT-D4 project provides first class API support Fortran, C and Python.\nOther programming languages should try to interface with to DFT-D4 via one of those three APIs.\nTo provide first class API support for a new language the interface specification should be available as meson build files. The dftd4 binary provides with the --json option access to all quantities available from the APIs as well. Fortran API The recommended way to access the Fortran module API is by using dftd4 as a meson subproject.\nAlternatively, the project is accessible by the Fortran package manager ( fpm ). The complete API is available from dftd4 module, the individual modules are available to the user as well but are not part of the public API and therefore not guaranteed to remain stable.\nABI compatibility is only guaranteed for the same minor version. The communication with the Fortran API uses the error_type and structure_type of the modular computation tool chain library (mctc-lib) to handle errors and represent geometries, respectively. Building Vasp with support for D4 To use dftd4 in Vasp the compatibility layer for the 2.5.x API has to be enable with -Dapi_v2=true (meson) or -DWITH_API_V2=ON (CMake).\nIt is important to build dftd4 with the same Fortran compiler you build Vasp with. After you completed the installation of dftd4 , make sure it is findable by pkg-config , you can check by running: pkg-config --modversion dftd4 If your dftd4 installation is not findable, you have to update your environment variables.\nOne option is to provide a module file for your dftd4 installation.\nThe example module file below can be placed in your MODULEPATH to provide access to an installation in ~/opt/dftd4/4.0.2 .\nRetry the above comment after loading the dftd4 module and adjust the module file until pkg-config finds your installation. -- dftd4/4.0.2.lua local name = \"dftd4\" local version = \"4.0.2\" local prefix = pathJoin ( os.getenv ( \"HOME\" ), \"opt\" , name , version ) local libdir = \"lib\" -- or lib64 whatis ( \"Name        : \" .. name ) whatis ( \"Version     : \" .. version ) whatis ( \"Description : Generally applicable charge dependent London dispersion correction\" ) whatis ( \"URL         : https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4\" ) prepend_path ( \"PATH\" , pathJoin ( prefix , \"bin\" )) prepend_path ( \"MANPATH\" , pathJoin ( prefix , \"share\" , \"man\" )) prepend_path ( \"CPATH\" , pathJoin ( prefix , \"include\" )) prepend_path ( \"LIBRARY_PATH\" , pathJoin ( prefix , libdir )) prepend_path ( \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" , pathJoin ( prefix , libdir )) prepend_path ( \"PKG_CONFIG_PATH\" , pathJoin ( prefix , libdir , \"pkgconfig\" )) To enable support for D4 in Vasp add the following lines to the Makefile: CPP_OPTIONS += -DDFTD4 LLIBS += $( shell pkg-config --libs dftd4 ) INCS += $( shell pkg-config --cflags dftd4 ) Depending on how you built DFT-D4, DFT-D4’s dependencies might not be properly recognized during the VASP build. Try to explicitly add them to the link line. CPP_OPTIONS += -DDFTD4 LLIBS += $( shell pkg-config --libs dftd4 ) -lmulticharge -lmctc-lib -lmstore INCS += $( shell pkg-config --cflags dftd4 ) If you still run into issues, check out VASP-related issues on the dftd4 issue tracker. C API The C API provides access to the basic Fortran objects and their most important methods to interact with them.\nAll Fortran objects are available as opaque void* in C and can only be manipulated with the correct API calls.\nTo evaluate a dispersion correction in C four objects are available: the error handler: Simple error handler to carry runtime exceptions created by the library.\n   Exceptions can be handled and/or transfered to the downstream error handling system by this means. the molecular structure data: Provides a representation of the molecular structure with immutable number of atoms, atomic species, total charge and boundary conditions.\n   The object provides a way to update coordinates and lattice parameters, to update immutable quantities the object has to be recreated. the dispersion model: Instantiated for a given molecular structure type, it carries no information on the geometry but relies on the atomic species of the structure object.\n   Recreating a structure object requires to recreate the dispersion model as well. the damping parameters: Damping parameter object determining the short-range behaviour of the dispersion correction.\n   Standard damping parameters like the rational damping are independent of the molecular structure and can easily be reused for several structures or easily exchanged. The user is responsible for creating and deleting the objects to avoid memory leaks.\nFor convenience the type-generic macro dftd4_delete is available to free any memory allocation made in the library. Python API The Python API is disabled by default and can be built in-tree or out-of-tree.\nThe in-tree build is mainly meant for end users and packages.\nTo build the Python API with the normal project set the python option in the configuration step with meson setup _build -Dpython = true -Dpython_version = $( which python3 ) The Python version can be used to select a different Python version, it defaults to 'python3' .\nPython 2 is not supported with this project, the Python version key is meant to select between several local Python 3 versions. Proceed with the build as described before and install the projects to make the Python API available in the selected prefix. For the out-of-tree build see the instructions in the python directory.
